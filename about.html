            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
                Hi, my name is <strong>OLA OYE Sulaimon Adekunle</strong>, a passionate web developer with a keen eye for design and functionality. I specialize in creating sleek, responsive websites that not only look great but also deliver seamless user experiences.
            </p>

            <p>
                I love working with international clients, especially in <strong>DTC (Direct-to-Consumer) brands</strong>, helping businesses turn their vision into a digital reality. I’m driven by creativity, modern web technologies, and attention to detail in every project I take on.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beyond coding, I have a love for fashion, I’m also a fragrance enthusiast and love smelling great, which reflects my focus on aesthetics and sensory experiences in both life and work.
            </p>

            <p>Let’s create something amazing together.</p>
